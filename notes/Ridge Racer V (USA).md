Ridge Racer V|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸|ðŸŸ§|`Use OpenGL Video Backend`

Notes
:-------|
Using `Sofware Backend` and the best performance during intro but gameplay sits at around 40FPS
Using `Vulkan Backend` offers good gameplay performance, has graphical issues at the loading menu, and intro is slow
Using `OpenGL Backend` offers good gameplay performance but intro is slow. It has the least amount of issues out of the 3 rendering options.
